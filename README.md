This repository contains a growing list of JavaScript Job interview questions 
and related resources.

Currently, it may look more like "Interview Questions in JavaScript" rather 
than "JavaScript" Interview Questions. I mean the emphasis is on the interview,
rather than on JavaScript, so to speak. However, I will be adding more 
domain-specific JS/DOM/CSS3/HTML5 questions once I cover the basics, such as 
algorithms, linked lists, stacks etc -- which appear in job interviews
regardless of your domain of expertise.

I use nodejs to run examples. However any decent browser should equally work.

//TODO: update this readme.
